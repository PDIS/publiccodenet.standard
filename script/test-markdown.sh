# As part of reviewing a contribution, reviewers are responsible for checking

# Lint markdown using the Markdownlint gem with the default ruleset except for:
# MD007 Unordered list indentation: we allow sub-lists to also have bullets
# MD013 Line length: we allow long lines
# MD029 Ordered list item prefix: we allow lists to be sequentially numbered
